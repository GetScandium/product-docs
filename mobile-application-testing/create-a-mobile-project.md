# Create a mobile project

Scandium gives you the ability to test your native mobile applications right within a web browser. With Scandium, you can test both native Android and iOS apps.

### How to create a mobile project

Before you can begin to upload mobile apps for testing, you need to create a Mobile project on your Scadium account.

On the project creation page, from the "project type" dropdown, select "Mobile" from the list.
