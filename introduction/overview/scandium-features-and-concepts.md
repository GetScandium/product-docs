# Scandium Features & Concepts

In this article, we will take a look at the features Scandium offers and some of the terms and concepts you need to get familiar with.



**Projects**

A project in Scandium is how you organize and manage your resources on Scandium. As a Scandium user, you are able to create multiple projects for different purposes. E.g. you can have a project for your production environment, a project for your staging/testing environment etc. Or perhaps different projects for different teams.

When you create an account on Scandium, a default project is created for you, you can rename this project or add new ones.



**Test Cases**

A test case is a recorded user journey. A test case defines a collection of steps carried out to satisfy a particular user journey. For example, a test case can be created to test how the “Add to Cart” feature of an e-commerce app works. A test case will also often be referred to as a test scenario or simply scenario.

Scandium allows you to create as many test cases as you need for your app within a project.



**Folders**

With folders, you can group related test cases for easier identification. Folders work similarly to the folders on your computer. You can have multiple folders created.\


**Test Steps**

A test case is made up of multiple test steps. When creating/recording a test, each action on your application is converted to a step. A step is also referred to as an Event. Examples of test steps include “click”, “type”, “mouse scroll” etc.\


**Test Runs**

Recording your test case is only half of what needs to be done. The purpose of creating a test case is so you can run/replay the scenario to validate for success or failure.

A test run on Scandium shows you the result of executing/running/replaying an existing test case.

You can run your test cases using the Scandium Browser Extension (which runs locally on your computer), or run remotely on the Scandium Cloud Runner.
