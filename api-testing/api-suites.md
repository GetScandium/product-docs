# API Suites

A test suite is a collection of test cases that often share similar rules and configurations.

After you have created your test cases, you ideally don't want to run them one by one. Instead, you want to run multiple test cases at a time.

Let's look at a few situations where you might want to run a test suite instead of a single test case:

1. You want to run certain critical test cases in your deployment pipeline during deployment.
2. You want to run certain test cases at a scheduled frequency.
3. You want to run all test cases related to a particular module or feature.
4. You want to manually run all or many test cases within a project.

The above situations and more can necessitate the need for test suites. You can create different suites for different purposes.

Scandium allows you to create and manage test suites easily.
