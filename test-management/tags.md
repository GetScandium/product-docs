  tests.

# Tags

When you label tests with tags, you are categorizing them based on certain shared similarities even if they don't necessarily belong in the same folder/suites.

A test case can have multiple tags, you can apply these tags as filter when searching for test cases.

For example, you can add a `Critical` label tag to tests that must run in your pipeline.



### Adding/Removing Test Tags

1. On the Tests listing page, click on the options icon of a test
2.  Click on 'Tags' from the popup menu\
